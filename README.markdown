# Untitled Catherine Dossin API

This is code that serves as the preliminary (early 2012) API into Professor Catherine Dossin's art history data. This project and the code here that represents it is meant to be a pilot, of sorts, that will eventually bolt onto a much larger effort out of a collaboration between various European humanities agencies.
